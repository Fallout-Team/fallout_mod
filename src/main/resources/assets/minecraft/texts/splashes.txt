Rest in Peace, Bernard Cribbins.+
War never changes...+
It's the end of the world, all over again.+
And don't get me started on the futility of dusting a collapsed house!+
Revolutionising safety for an uncertain future!+
Protect the people at a minute's notice.+
Of the people, for the people.+
Ring-a-ding-ding baby! I got your back.+
Finding it though, that's not the hard part. It's letting go.+
The last thing you never see.+
Thumbs down, you son of a bitch.+
Shhhh... we're hunting shitheads...+
Gary? Gaaaryyy...!+
WHO WON THE LOTTERY??!! I DID!!!+
We can afford all we need, we cannot afford all we want.+
The thing about happiness is that you only know you had it when it's gone.+
There will come a time when diplomacy and tact will prove to be useless and your hand must be raised instead...+
In all things a calm heart must prevail.+
You sick, vindictive fuck!+
YOU ARE OUT OF UNIFORM SOLDIER! WHERE IS YOUR POWER ARMOR?!
